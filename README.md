# CoinMarketCap Spring Boot Wrapper
A simple wrapper for the CoinMarketCap API built as a reusable & configurable Spring Boot microservice. The goal is to provide a simple configurable service for procuring cryptocurrency and exchange data from the CoinMarketCap API. As a way to protect your unique API key, CoinMarketCap disallows developers from calling their API from a client using Javascript (CORS restriction). This service, written in Java, can act as a mediator between your client and the CoinMarketCap API. For larger projects, this service can be called from other server-side services to support a full microservice architecture and/or implement caching.

Each REST endpoint of the Spring Boot application correlates to an endpoint of the CoinMarketCap API. For example, a call to https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest and http://localhost:9898/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest will return the same data.

For more information on REST endpoints and CoinMarketCap data, check out the Javadoc within the `/doc/` folder or https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/

**NOTE:** By default, this service runs on port `9898`. This can be changed in its application.properties file.

**_RantCrypto and its developers are not affiliated, sponsored, nor otherwise endorsed by CoinMarketCap. Special care has been taken to acheive compatibility with CoinMarketCap's Commercial User Agreement (https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/user-agreement-commercial). When you are using CoinMarketCap Spring Boot Wrapper, you must adhere to this agreement._**

## Quick Start
1. If you have not already, sign up for a developer account to obtain an API key at https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/signup
2. Download or clone the code from this repository. If downloaded as a .zip file, extract the code.
3. Navigate to application.properties and assign your API key to `com.rantcrypto.cmc.api.v1.api-key`. Save the file.
4. In a command prompt or terminal, navigate into the project folder. Run the `./mvnw spring-boot:run` command to start the application.
5. Test your configuration by navigating to http://localhost:9898/v1/key/info in your web browser.

## Notes
There are a few important things to note before using this service:
- For security and cost-saving in commercial projects, it is *highly* recommended to implement a caching mechanism.
- Use CoinMarketCap id's instead of symbols or slugs where possible. Some cryptocurrencies share the same symbol.
- By default, this service will reach out to the CoinMarketCap sandbox at `https://sandbox-api.coinmarketcap.com`. To connect to the real-time pro API, set `com.rantcrypto.cmc.api.v1.base-url=https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com` in application.properties

## Roadmap
The status of the project roadmap can be found below:
- [x] Host Spring Boot REST endpoints which correlate to every CoinMarketCap API endpoint
- [x] Develop a service layer to parse parameters & get a response from the CoinMarketCap API; Each worker is called from a Spring Boot REST endpoint
- [x] Add documentation which correlates to the official documentation at https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/ and generate Javadoc
- [x] Handle all exceptions from the CoinMarketCap API and forward them back to the client with the same status code and response body
- [x] Configure the service easily through application.properties file. Change the base url (sandbox or pro) and add your own API key
- [x] JUnit unit testing for all endpoints
- [ ] A simple caching mechanism which is configurable in application.properties
- [ ] Add support for simple JSON transformations in application.properties
- [ ] Add profiles to automatically use CoinMarketCap's sandbox API in dev/test environments, and their pro API in production environment
- [ ] Add ability to obtain API key from a secure S3 Bucket for higher security
- [ ] Add support for additional features, such as real-time pricing and `/v1/exchange/listings/historical`, when CoinMarketCap makes them available through their API

## Configure with application.properties
