These Terms of Use (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of this application programming interface (the "API"), and associated content, software and applications (collectively, the "Service"). These Terms also include our Privacy Policy, which is located at https://coinmarketcap.com/privacy.

The Service is administered and maintained by CoinMarketCap OpCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CMC"). The terms "we", "us" and "our" also refer to CMC.

The term "you" refers to the individual using this Service and/or your company or other legal entity. The term "Your Product" means and includes no more than one: website, domain, subdomain, software application, channel, bot, or service, which is owned and operated by you, and which you have registered as either a Publisher of Content or Developer using Content from this Service, and which is used by individuals for their own personal, non-commercial use.

Please read these Terms carefully. They contain important information regarding your legal rights, including limitations on CMC's and certain third parties' liability, disclaimers of warranties and a submission to jurisdiction. BY CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON BELOW, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO AND CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY.

Eligibility and Registration
In order to publish or use any Content in Your Product, you will need to register for a Product account (a "CMC Developer Account"). You must be at least 18 years old to register for a CMC Developer Account and to otherwise use the Service. During the registration process, we will ask you for information, including your name and other personal information to verify your identity, and a method of payment. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to open a CMC Developer Account for you, or limit the number of CMC Developer Accounts that you may hold. In addition, if Your Product has more than 100,000 unique monthly visitors or users, as determined by CMC based on sources selected by CMC (which sources may include, by way of example, Alexa.com, Google Play Store and Apple Store), you may be required to upgrade to an Enterprise Use License. You may not use the Service if we have terminated any account of yours or banned you.

License
You may only use the Service as expressly permitted by these Terms. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by CMC, its third-party providers and other respective owners, if any.

CMC provides content through the Service that is copyrighted and/or trademarked work of CMC or CMC’s third-party licensors and suppliers (collectively, the "Content"). For clarity, Content shall include all content accessed by you at any time, whether before or after the date you accepted these Terms. You acknowledge that the Service has been developed, compiled, prepared, revised, selected, and arranged by CMC and such third parties through the application of methods and standards of judgment developed and applied through the expenditure of substantial time, effort, and money and constitutes valuable intellectual property of CMC and such others. Accordingly, you shall protect the proprietary rights of CMC and all others having rights in the Service during and after the term of this agreement and comply with all reasonable written requests made by CMC to protect its and others’ contractual, statutory, and common law rights in the Service.

Subject to these Terms, and your compliance with these Terms, CMC hereby grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable (except as expressly provided below) and non-transferable license to use, reproduce, display, adapt, perform and store the Content solely on Your Product provided solely to end users of Your Product who are utilizing Your Product for their own personal, non-commercial purposes ("End Users"); provided, however, that the foregoing rights with respect to non-same day Content shall vary depending on the subscription selected, as follows:

Startup Subscription: same day Content only

Standard Subscription: Content with respect to the prior one (1) month period only (e.g., on March 15, the Standard subscription permits such usage of the Content covering the period February 15 through March 15)

Professional – Content with respect to the prior one (1) year period (e.g., on March 15, 2018 the Professional subscription permits such usage of the Content covering the period March 15, 2017 through March 15, 2018).

For clarity (a) you may charge a fee for such usage by End Users, (b) you may temporarily store the Content to the extent necessary in order to make the Content available via Your Product, and (c) you may not distribute the Content on a standalone basis but instead only as part of Your Product. If you breach any of these Terms, the above license will terminate automatically.

Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction
These Terms and any and all claims, disputes or other legal proceedings by or between you and us, including but not limited to any claims or disputes that are in any way related to or arising out of these Terms or your use of or access to the Service, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with U.S. federal law and the laws of Delaware, without regard to any principles of conflicts of law.

Termination
CMC may terminate these Terms in the event you materially breach these Terms and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days of notice thereof. Upon expiration or termination, all license rights hereunder shall cease, you shall immediately destroy all Content in your possession or control and you shall have no further right to access or use the Service in any manner.

General
These Terms, and any other terms or agreements referenced herein, including our Privacy Policy (which can be accessed at https://coinmarketcap.com/privacy), constitute the entire agreement between you and CMC relating to your use of the Service and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and CMC with respect to the Service. A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

You agree that no joint venture, agency, partnership, or employment relationship exists between you and CMC and/or its affiliates as a result of these Terms or use of the Service.

In no event shall CMC be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services. Our performance under these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms limits our right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of the Service or publication or use of any Content, or any information provided to, or gathered by, us with respect to such use. To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to your access or use of this Service within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.

These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by CMC without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment by you in violation hereof shall be null and void.

If any provision of these Terms, including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth above, is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalid or unenforceable provisions in these Terms shall be deemed superseded by valid and enforceable provisions that, to the extent possible, fulfill the business purposes and intent of such invalid and unenforceable provisions.

In addition to and without limiting the preceding paragraph, some U.S. states and foreign countries may provide rights in addition to those provided in the above "Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability" section or do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or liability for incidental or consequential damages. Therefore, the limitations set forth in the above Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability section may not apply to you in whole or in part, or there may be state or country specific provisions that superseded such limitations in whole or in part. Any provision of the above Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability section that is declared invalid shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder.

Any heading or section title contained herein is for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms. The terms "include" and "including" are deemed to include the phrase "without limitation" immediately thereafter.
